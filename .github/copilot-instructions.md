# Core Philosophy
- **Minimalist Communication:** Use clear, concise, lower-case-friendly text. No fluff.
- **Lean Code:** No boilerplate docs, no `unwrap()`, no unnecessary `mut`.
- **Safety First:** If it doesn't pass `clippy`, don't suggest it.
- **Atomic Changes:** One fix at a time. Run `cargo check` after every logic change.

#### Good-To-Knows
Language: Rust
Framework: Axum + React

# Prompting

Nothing fancy, minimal text is required.

If you must add text, make it clear and concise.
There is no need for any type of grammar, keep it to the basics (periods and commas).

# Code Styling

You must make variables immutable if they can be.
Use guard-clauses to prevent sluggish code.
Code should explain itself, do not add comments unless it's a really, really weird block of code.
Never add documentation unless said otherwise in the prompt.
Accept all Rust's code styling.

# Critical Thinking

Before changing any line of code, ensure it's the proper way of fixing the bug/syntax error.
The smaller, the better. If an error (or bug) can be fixed easily, use that method instead.'

When anybody asks you to fix anything, run the codebase first to get errors, debug output, or traces.

After you run the code, find clues in the output, then carefully change the code.
Run the codebase after small changes and if something breaks, just simply revert it and find a new way of doing things

# Thinking Before Executing

Always think before executing, if a change is redundant and doesn't actually fix the problem, don't do it!
Changing anything that I don't ask you to change is not acceptable.

Do not go above-and-beyond if I don't say so, this will cause more problems.

# Context

It's recommended to look through the project even if the file you are editing isn't relevant.

When you're editing something that requires refactoring, keep it all one code style.
Refactoring should never change an entire file.


## General Instructions

- Always prioritize readability, safety, and maintainability.
- Use strong typing and leverage Rust's ownership system for memory safety.
- Break down complex functions into smaller, more manageable functions.
- For algorithm-related code, include explanations of the approach used.
- Write code with good maintainability practices, including comments on why certain design decisions were made.
- Handle errors gracefully using `Result<T, E>` and provide meaningful error messages.
- For external dependencies, mention their usage and purpose in documentation.
- Use consistent naming conventions following [RFC 430](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0430-finalizing-naming-conventions.md).
- Write idiomatic, safe, and efficient Rust code that follows the borrow checker's rules.
- Ensure code compiles without warnings.

## Patterns to Follow

- Use modules (`mod`) and public interfaces (`pub`) to encapsulate logic.
- Handle errors properly using `?`, `match`, or `if let`.
- Use `serde` for serialization and `thiserror` or `anyhow` for custom errors.
- Implement traits to abstract services or external dependencies.
- Structure async code using `async/await` and `tokio` or `async-std`.
- Prefer enums over flags and states for type safety.
- Use builders for complex object creation.
- Split binary and library code (`main.rs` vs `lib.rs`) for testability and reuse.
- Use `rayon` for data parallelism and CPU-bound tasks.
- Use iterators instead of index-based loops as they're often faster and safer.
- Use `&str` instead of `String` for function parameters when you don't need ownership.
- Prefer borrowing and zero-copy operations to avoid unnecessary allocations.

### Ownership, Borrowing, and Lifetimes

- Prefer borrowing (`&T`) over cloning unless ownership transfer is necessary.
- Use `&mut T` when you need to modify borrowed data.
- Explicitly annotate lifetimes when the compiler cannot infer them.
- Use `Rc<T>` for single-threaded reference counting and `Arc<T>` for thread-safe reference counting.
- Use `RefCell<T>` for interior mutability in single-threaded contexts and `Mutex<T>` or `RwLock<T>` for multi-threaded contexts.

## Patterns to Avoid

- Don't use `unwrap()` or `expect()` unless absolutely necessary—prefer proper error handling.
- Avoid panics in library code—return `Result` instead.
- Don't rely on global mutable state—use dependency injection or thread-safe containers.
- Avoid deeply nested logic—refactor with functions or combinators.
- Don't ignore warnings—treat them as errors during CI.
- Avoid `unsafe` unless required and fully documented.
- Don't overuse `clone()`, use borrowing instead of cloning unless ownership transfer is needed.
- Avoid premature `collect()`, keep iterators lazy until you actually need the collection.
- Avoid unnecessary allocations—prefer borrowing and zero-copy operations.

## Code Style and Formatting

- Follow the Rust Style Guide and use `rustfmt` for automatic formatting.
- Keep lines under 100 characters when possible.
- Place function and struct documentation immediately before the item using `///`.
- Use `cargo clippy` to catch common mistakes and enforce best practices.

## Error Handling

- Use `Result<T, E>` for recoverable errors and `panic!` only for unrecoverable errors.
- Prefer `?` operator over `unwrap()` or `expect()` for error propagation.
- Create custom error types using `thiserror` or implement `std::error::Error`.
- Use `Option<T>` for values that may or may not exist.
- Provide meaningful error messages and context.
- Error types should be meaningful and well-behaved (implement standard traits).
- Validate function arguments and return appropriate errors for invalid input.

## API Design Guidelines

### Common Traits Implementation
Eagerly implement common traits where appropriate:
- `Copy`, `Clone`, `Eq`, `PartialEq`, `Ord`, `PartialOrd`, `Hash`, `Debug`, `Display`, `Default`
- Use standard conversion traits: `From`, `AsRef`, `AsMut`
- Collections should implement `FromIterator` and `Extend`
- Note: `Send` and `Sync` are auto-implemented by the compiler when safe; avoid manual implementation unless using `unsafe` code

### Type Safety and Predictability
- Use newtypes to provide static distinctions
- Arguments should convey meaning through types; prefer specific types over generic `bool` parameters
- Use `Option<T>` appropriately for truly optional values
- Functions with a clear receiver should be methods
- Only smart pointers should implement `Deref` and `DerefMut`

### Future Proofing
- Use sealed traits to protect against downstream implementations
- Structs should have private fields
- Functions should validate their arguments
- All public types must implement `Debug`

## Testing and Documentation

- Write comprehensive unit tests using `#[cfg(test)]` modules and `#[test]` annotations.
- Use test modules alongside the code they test (`mod tests { ... }`).
- Write integration tests in `tests/` directory with descriptive filenames.
- Write clear and concise comments for each function, struct, enum, and complex logic.
- Ensure functions have descriptive names and include comprehensive documentation.
- Document all public APIs with rustdoc (`///` comments) following the [API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/).
- Use `#[doc(hidden)]` to hide implementation details from public documentation.
- Document error conditions, panic scenarios, and safety considerations.
- Examples should use `?` operator, not `unwrap()` or deprecated `try!` macro.

## Project Organization

- Use semantic versioning in `Cargo.toml`.
- Include comprehensive metadata: `description`, `license`, `repository`, `keywords`, `categories`.
- Use feature flags for optional functionality.
- Organize code into modules using `mod.rs` or named files.
- Keep `main.rs` or `lib.rs` minimal - move logic to modules.
