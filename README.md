# Overview
<p> Lunara is aimed to make local Minecraft server hosting easier, faster, and simpler.</p>
<p> I aim to make Lunara performance-based, this means that I will not be using shit frameworks.</p>
<p> Lunara is written in rust, with an asynchronous structure with the Axum framework.</p>
<p> If you are having any issues with building or running Lunara make sure you are running the containerized version.</p>
